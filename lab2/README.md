# Lab 2: Basic File Server

## Introduction
This lab implements a workable (local) file system. You should complete other layers using the FUSE module.

## Hints
You may refer to [`fuse_lowlevel.h`](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse/blob/master/include/fuse_lowlevel.h) in FUSE source code for needed function prototypes to implement symbolic link.
